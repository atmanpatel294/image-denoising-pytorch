# Image Denoising using PyTorch
Implementation of image denoising in PyTorch on the [The Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/segbench/).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7.4
- pytorch 1.2.0
- jupyter notebook

## Running Instructions

Clone this repo on your local machine. Download the dataset from [The Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/segbench/) and extract it in the this folder.

Just run the ipython notebook in your local machine. Adjust the data path as required. It might run slower on cpu.
